Parsing:
	- make it so it detects .cub instead of .ber as filename
	- instead of P (for player) its indicated by NSEW, north east south west to indicate the direction where player is facing
	-the map should be surrouned by walls, this differs from the way its detected by so_long because the maps aren't square anymore
	- check attributes at start (color north east south west and their texture files)
